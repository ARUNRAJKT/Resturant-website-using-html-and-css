        </div>
        <div class="c">A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.[1] Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer 
             take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food 
             restaurants and cafeterias, to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments. <a href="#">Take away!</a>

         <div class="h">Prepare crab by removing outer shell, mouth, eyes and apron. Remove the lungs, the "dead man", and the guts from the center of the crab, keeping claws and legs intact.* The crab is now ready to fry. 
             Dip crabs into batter and deep fry for 3- 5 minutes, until crab floats and turns golden brown.King crab is naturally lean, low in calories and bursting with flavor â€” and that makes it a natural addition to any salad! 
             Try it atop a loaded Cobb salad, with romaine lettuce, tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, crumbled blue cheese, avocado, and bacon. Dress it with a nice olive oil,
              red wine vinegar, salt and pepper, and youre in for a tasty, heart-healthy meal! </div>
